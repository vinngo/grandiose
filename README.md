This is a simple NextJS project bootstrapped with Bun. Art is intentionally minimalistic and offputting to the eye.

## Getting started with contribution

As a contributor, you're only allowed to modify `src/prompts.ts`. If there's any breaking change or bug that needs to be addressed, create a GitHub issue.

#### Good notes
Getting started with development and dependencies are missing:
```bash
bun install
```

How to run a build for successful PR:

```bash
bun run build
```

How to run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Rules of prompts
The **Insufferable Test** is not meant for generalizing TikTok. This is specifically (but NOT limited to) chronically online individuals on short-form video platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels.

Your questions should pertain to that crowd, and also must be in simple past tense form. Assume that your question will always start with "Have you ever..."

If you are non-technical (e.g. you don't know how to contribute, but you have a good question) DM me on Twitter or Instagram (@jsonvinh) with your question!
